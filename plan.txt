Here is your complete system architecture, broken down into phases, modules, data flow, interconnections, dashboard logic, and recommended build order.

This is the engineering blueprint for building your Life OS.
You can follow this step-by-step while coding — everything is structured for actual development.

1. High-Level Architecture Overview

Your Personal Care Life OS has 6 Core Modules:

Task Manager

Habit Tracker

Sleep Tracker

Finance Tracker

Journaling System

Life Calendar + Analytics Engine

Each module writes data → stored in database → analytics engine reads it → dashboard displays summaries.

Everything revolves around the Dashboard and the Life Calendar.

2. Recommended Development Order (Very Important)

Build in this exact order to avoid confusion, breakpoints, and redesign.

Phase 1 – Core Foundations

Authentication (optional initially)

User Profile + Settings

Dashboard skeleton

Task Manager (most important module)

Phase 2 – Daily Routine Modules

Habit Tracker

Sleep Tracker

Attendance

Daily Logger (mood, notes)

Phase 3 – Finance + Journaling

Expense Tracker

Journaling (text first)

Media journaling (images, videos)

Phase 4 – Life Visualization + Insights

Weekly Reflection

Life Calendar

Achievements Engine

Analytics Engine (graphs, insights)

Phase 5 – Enhancements

Export system

Notifications

AI suggestions (later)

3. Detailed Architecture by Module

Below is a breakdown of what each module does, how it works, where it shows up, and how it connects to everything else.

Data Table (Tasks)

task_id
user_id
title
description
deadline
priority
category
status
created_at
completed_at

Internal Logic
